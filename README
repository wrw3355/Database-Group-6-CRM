    databasediagram-revised.png - The final version of our ER diagram for the system we implemented. Many changes were
    made to the design of the system throughout the project's development. Attributes and relationships were removed
    due to redundancy. The deletion of these attributes and relationships made the system much simpler and overall
    made it less complicated.
