                Our idea for this project is a CRM application for businesses. This application would be used to manage quotes, orders, accounts, contacts and other business entities to manage their company and associated resources.
                <br><br>
                Businesses need a way to manage their quotes, orders and potential customers. Many companies want to track quotes made for customers and to have the ability to convert those quotes to paying orders with much overhead. Companies require the ability to track past and potential future customers. Additionally, the company wants to be able to require accounts in the system to control access to this data for protection reasons.
                <br><br>
                This can be accomplished with a CRM system using a database management system to store the various pieces of data for the CRM system. The entities that would be represented in our system are, but not limited to, quotes, orders, competitors, products, and contacts. More types of entities will most likely be identified when making our E-R diagrams. Because of its real world applications, it should be fairly easy for us to find sample data to enter into our databases for testing purposes. We plan to enter data for many real world companies such as the products they make, different competitors for them, past customers and potential customers.
                <br><br>
                This application will utilize all of the aspects of CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) on the data stored in the database. Our plan is to include a web interface for the system that will allow the end user to perform operations on the data. This will most likely be implemented through a JSP. The underlying system will then use JDBC or Hibernate to interact with the database as a result of the actions taken by the user. Users will be able to enter quotes, convert quotes to orders, add customers and potential future customers, add contacts, and manage accounts through our system. As a result, businesses will reduce the amount of overhead in the quote to cash process and will be more efficient with their day-to-day  operations.
